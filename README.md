## Face detection using Python and OpenCV

## Step 1: Install OpenCV
Go to command line and run these commands:
Go to Python CLI: python

Read more about OpenCV on Wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV

## Step 2: download source code
Download the source code from GIT https://github.com/anil-ajax/AI_Face_Detection
* Most of the work is done by OpenCV library. The script we have written just calls the library and pass image and xml as inputs. XML defines what to detect i.e. a face in this case.

## Step 3: go to code folder and run command
Python face_detect.py sample.png facedetection.xml
You should see an image popup like one below.
